ANNAMANIACS : ARTICLE SPORTS ILLUST.</FONT></FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>At
16, that's what Russian phenom Anna Kournikova has in addition to talent,
sex appeal and a 'good friend' with a Stanley Cup ring...</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">By Michael Silver</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Clad in an airtight
black pants ensemble that only a snake or a super hero could love, Anna
Kournikova, the 16-year-old Russian tennis phenom, reclines in a stretch
limousine and brushes her blonde hair from head to&nbsp; waist. She flashes
a precocious smile and asks you to hold her nail polish while she digs
into her purse for a piece of bubble gum.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova, the
teen sex pot with a romantic link to a 28-year-old hockey star, appears
to be flirting with you. And despite the fact that you are a happily married
man who's twice Kournikova's age--and that her mother, Alla, who's sitting
next to her, could have been your high school doubles partner--you appear
to be flirting back. What better time to ask about the attention she has
received for her appearance, which has lured legions of ogling male to
her matches and inspired scores of Web sites on the Internet? Although
Kournikova reached the Wimbledon semifinals last year, is ranked 25th&nbsp;
in the world and is regarded as a potential superstar, she's known primarily
for her pretty face, curvaceous body and frequently revealing</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">clothes. "It's
human nature for people to notice," she says."If I had plastic surgery
to make me look worse, maybe that would help. People ask me, 'why do you
have to look good on the court? Why not just play?' But to me, whenever
I'm on the court, it's like theater, and I have to express myself. Why
should I have to look ugly just because I'm an athlete?"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Not since the
retirement of Argentina's Gabriella Sabatani in October 1996 has a tennis
player been such a sex symbol. But what sets Kournikova apart from Sabatini,
whose looks prompted the Great American Doll Company to launch a line of
dolls in her likeness, is the enthusism with which she has embraced the
role.&nbsp; Sitting back in the limo, Kournikova gleefully recounts the
reception she received at the Australian Open in January: "One guy held
up a sign that said,'Anna, call me at so-and-so. Both me and my phone will
be turned on.' "Its hard to tell which persona Kournikova relishes more,
that of provocateur or that of</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">princess.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"Anna knows everything,
and what she doesn't know, she thinks she knows," says Nick Bollettieri,
who accepted Kournikova at his tennis academy in Bradenton, Fla., when
she was 10 and still advises her." From the moment she arrrived here, she
knew who she was and wanted everybody else to know who she was,"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">At the academy
Kournikova befriended a 13-year old German boy named Tommy Haas. "She early&nbsp;
on she was good-looking and good on the court,"recalls Haas, who turns
20 next week and is a rising star on the men's tour. "She was&nbsp;&nbsp;
mostly stuck-up and treated people not so well. She knew she could get
away with it."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">There's and attitude
, and there's Anna-tude, and the latter knows no bounds. Of meeting the
Spice Girls in Australia,Kournikova shrugs and says,"It was a big deal
for everyone but not for me" When asked about the pronunciation of her
name- Chris Evert and other TV tennis&nbsp; analysts refer to her as AHN-ya---Kournikova
says dismissively, "No, it's AH-na. That's just people trying to be cool
and pretend they know Russian. As if!"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova can
be whimsical and girlish, quoting lines from the move Clueless and reveling
in the excitement that surrounds her, but it's advisable not to treat her
like a beer commercial babe. When one of the many whiplash candidates who
passes Kournikova at a crowded Southern California concert venue offers
a panting hello, she answers," Good-bye." Later she says playfully,"It's
like a menu: They can look, but they can't afford it."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">One suitor for
whom that doesn't apply is her compatriot Sergei Fedorov, the Detroit Red
Wings' star center, who recently signed a $38 million contract. He has
accompanied Kournikova in public on numerous occasions, sometimes carrying
her tennisgear and, some bystanders say, catering to her every whim. Kournikova
does nothing to thwart the impression that she's in control. Asked by on
young make in a Red wings hat, "Are you his girl-friend?" Kournikova glares
and answers, "He wishes."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova views
herself as less prima donna that pre-madonna. She's great fan of the pop
chameleon,</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">whose first album
was released around the time of Kournikova's second birthday. "I admire
Madonna</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">as an artist,"
Kournikova says. "It's unbelievable how she's always changing and stay's
in the spotlight.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">She's not a hit
for one day. She will be around for a long time."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">It's early March,
two days before Kournikova's first match in the Evert Cup tournament in
Indian Wells,</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Calif., and Anna
and Alla are dressed identically, in tight Adidas workout gear. They giggle
as they recount</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">having been recognized
by an airline employee in Miami the previous day and upgraded to first
class for the flight to LA. Anna is asked if her mother accompanies her
everywhere, and she smiles at Alla and nods. Then she turns away from her
mother, whose english is spotty, and says,"But it's not what you think.
I do what I want."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova is
one of a quintet of talented&nbsp; teenagers that has energized the women's
tour. The others are No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis: No. 11 Venus Williams
and her sister, Serena, No. 40; and No. 46 Mirjana Lucic. "I think Anna
can hang with any of them," says Bollettieri. "Anna is a shotmaker. She
has the ability to create situations on the court that very few people
cancreate. And at the net she's brilliant. She hits volleys from all angles.
The only person I could compare her to is John McEnroe."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Says Billie Jean
King, "The only question with Anna is, How badly does she want it? Does&nbsp;
she want to make the most money, like Sabatini did, or does she want to
be Number 1?" Like Sabatini, Kournikova is a hot endorsement property;
she has lucrative deals with Adidas, Yonex and Rolex, among other companies.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"Anna can become
a superstar of unbelievable magnitude," says Charlie Pasarell, the top-ranked
male player in the US in 1967, Who's director of the Indian Wells tournament.
"You can tell she's special just by looking at her. She walks like a champion,"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Obviously people
are looking at more than the 5'8", 123-pound Kournikova's walk. During
her run at Wimbledon last year, which included a victory over French Open
champion Iva Majoli, British tabloids had a field with her. " They ran
all those photos of my butt," she says.&nbsp; "But, hey, it wasn't fat.
My pictures were great." In Sydney, at a warmup tournament for the Australian
Open, a fist fight broke out</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">between spectators
attempting to grab Kournikova's sweaty towel after a practice session.
Then, at the Open, tow fervent male fans paid homage to their heroine by
putting on blonde wigs and dresses. Ten others held a banner that read
ANNA, WILL YOU MARRY ME? Says Kournikova, "The only question I had was,
Which one? Should I marry all of them?"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Even a practice
session on a weekday afternoon in Indian Wells, in the sleepy Southern
California Desert, draws a heavy surge of testosterone. Kournikova plays
to her admirers without acknowledging them, at one point turning her back
to the crowd and shaking her&nbsp; fat-free butt at her coach, Pavel Slozil.
Alla, 35, gets her share of attention, too. A ball boy gasps, "Anna's your
daughter? I thought she was your friend."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">If Anna is a princess,
Alla is a queen. "Mama is the head coach and always will be," says Bollettieri.
"You can't fight Mama, because she and Anna are very close."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Slozil says that
Alla, like many tennis moms, "is a little bit crazy, and you have to be.
Otherwise you're just average. But she's positve crazy, not like Mary Pierce's
father. It's not easy being in her position. She and Anna are like sister
to sister, but sometimes Alla must be the mother, and sometimes the father,
too."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">The father, Sergei,
a former Greco-Roman wrestler who works in the Russian physical culture
ministry, stayed behind in Moscow when his wife and their only child moved
to Florida in 1992. The Kournikova's reunite when Anna has downtime or
when Sergei travels to a tournament, which he does five or six times a
year. "It is hard, but I'm not one of those people who cries about it,"
Alla says. "She's my child, and I want to be there for her. What else would
I be doing?"</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">When Anna was
five, she joined a youth club that congregated at Moscow's Soklniki Park.
In addition to playing tennis, Anna spent her days jogging, hiking, taking
amusement park rides and eating ice cream. "We were regular, average people,"
she says.By the time Anna was eight, Alla and Sergei had realized that
they had a prodigy. Within two years they had signed Anna up with IMG,
and mother and daughter had shipped out for Bollettieri's. Two years later
Anna, who ended 1995 as the ITF junior world champion, would play in her
first pro tournament.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"In Russia there
is no word for boyfriend," Kournikova says. "You're either married or you're
friends. Maybe people want to see Sergei as my boyfriend, but he's just
a good friend of mine--a very good friend. OUr families are close. We came
from the same background, and we have a lot in common."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">True, the families
seem friendly, and Alla says of Anna and Sergei, "They're friends. It's
normal." But press Anna for details of the friendship, and she gets squeamish.
She says that she and Fedorov met on a Moscow tennis court, but she won't
specify when, saying only, "it was years ago."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Haas says that
"nothing ever happened" between Kournikova and him at Bollettier's "partly
because she already had a boyfriend--Fedorov. I think she was 14."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Says Kournikova,
"It doesn't matter how old you are. Why shold other people tell me who
I should be friends with or what I should do? They're not perfect themselves,
and it's none of their business.Some things are personal. You wouldn't
say what you did with your wife, either."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">But much of Kournikova's
personal life has been lived in public.Last June, shortly after the Red
Wings won the Stanley Cup on Kournikova's 16th Birthday, she rode in a
car with Fedorov in a</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">victory parade
in Detroit. A few weeks later, during Wimbledon, they were seen together
at the All England Club and around London. Detroit Free Press columnist
Mitch Albom wrote of encountering Fedorov and saying hello to Fedorov,
who greeted him with what seemed to be a nervous smile.According to Albom,
Fedorov didn't introduce him to Kournikova and was "wiggling like a sixth-grader
spotted by his pals while talking to a girl."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">At last summer's
US open, Fedorov, who declined&nbsp; to be interviewed for this story,
attended Kournikova's matches. This led the New York Post to quote someone
in the Queens district attorney's office as saying, "Mr. Fedorov had better
watch his step.Or more to the point, he had better watch his hands."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova rolls
her eyes as the quote is recounted to her. "Where did that attorney come
from?" she asks. "Who is he to care? When I go to New York this year, I'll
be 17, and I've been told that's the</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">legal age there.
So I can do whatever I want. At this year's Open, I'll have five boyfriends."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Kournikova's maturity,
or lack of it, is an issue with some players."She's the type of girl who
one day says hi and the next day walks right by you, so I just stopped
saying hi," says Lindsay Davenport, the No. 2 ranked woman player. "She
loves to create attention, She's always looking around to make sure that
spotlight's on her."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"Forget what the
players say," Kournikova says. "Ask the fans. I think it's normal for people
to be jealous. But I've never been jealous of anybody. I've never said,
'I wish I was her.' Honestly, I wish I was me."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Hingis says, "but
I'm sure she would like to change places with me if she could and have
four Grand Slam titles." The Hingis-Kournikova rivalry has been hyped since
both were juniors, but Kournikova is 0 for 3 against the world No. 1. "Everybody
else is making it up to be a rivalry," Hingis Says,"but so far, it hasn't
been."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">The last time
you talk to you Kournikova, she is positively giddy, a testament to sunshine,
California rolls and the silliness that comes from a surplus of frenetic
teenage energy. She doesn't want to end her interview without the final
word on her relationship with Fedorov. Sitting&nbsp; in the passenger seat
of a rented convertible, she makes a request. "I have a lot of boyfriends,"
she says." I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different
boyfriend. And I kiss them all."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">She blows a kiss
into the wind as the convertible races across the desert. Wherever she's
headed, she's damn sure enjoying the ride.</FONT></FONT></B>
