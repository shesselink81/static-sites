Sisters - Can They Save Tennis?</FONT></FONT></FONT></H2></CENTER>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">I've been hearing
over the last couple of years about how tennis is on the decline. People
aren't watching (or even playing) as much tennis as they used to.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Tennis today simply
isn't engaging our imagination the way it did in the hey-days of the 1970's
and 1980's. Back then you had great personalities like Jimmy Conners, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and John McEnroe. You had five minute debates
with umpires over bad calls, racquets flying after missed shots, and the
"game" of trying to figure out who was gay and who was not.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Tennis was a lot
of fun then.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Now, all you have
is just a whole bunch of the ball bouncing back and forth. Everyone keeps
their mouth shut. The drama just isn't there. There isn't even a great
rivalry to get excited about.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">That is, until
now.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">It hasn't reached
Conners-McEnroe status, but I believe the rivalry between sisters Venus
and Serena Williams will be a fun one to watch in the next few years.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">The two faced
each other recently in an early round at the Australian Open with Venus
coming out on top. Though I was only able to catch some of the highlights
on the sports shows, it seems to me that a lot of tennis' problems could
be solved by these two exciting players. Even in the video clips, it was
a thrill watching the colorfully beaded sisters fly through the air as
they streaked across the court.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Tennis needs a
soap opera for fans to latch on to in order to gain new spectators and
new participants. This could be the one: a sibling rivalry playing itself
out on the court in front of millions of people. They could be the Conners-McEnroe
or the Lloyd-Navratalova of the 21st century.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Another point
that must be noted is the Williams sisters are African-Americans. Not since
Arthur Ashe has tennis had a black superstar, and that shows in the public
and private tennis courts of America. Part of tennis' problem, and the
USTA in particular, is the lack of minority participation in tennis. And
while I have met several coaches and players involved in bringing tennis
to minorities through various camps and programs, there still needs to
be that superstar for kids to identify with.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">With the Williams'
sisters, there are two potential superstars waiting in the wings. I can
almost hear the young girls already fighting over which one is going to
be Venus and which one is going to be Serena. Tennis needs to jump on this
bandwagon now and be ready for to put the public relations machine into
high gear as these two sisters get a little older and better at their game.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Let's hope that
these sisters can bring tennis back to its glory-days and, at the same
time, take it to a whole new cultural level as well.</FONT></FONT></B>
