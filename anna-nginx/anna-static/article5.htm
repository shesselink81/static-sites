<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">...Obvious suggestions
that a movie career for Kournikova and the other kids are commenplace.
But the young Russian, who yesterday trounced Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-0,
6-0, is trying to maintain, not very convincingly, that all she is interested
in is playing tennis.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was Andre Agassi who patented the statement that 'Image Is Everything'.
But Kournikova , who has lived in the United States since she was nine
and recently relocated to the ultra-trendy South Beach in Miami, has taken
the whole thing a step further. Every where she goes she attracts a crowd.
Her practice sessions are surrounded by vast throngs of fans, varying in
age</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">of more than
half a century.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She is becoming something of a veteran on the sofas of the American chat
show hosts like David Letterman and Jay Leno. And the Spice Girls&nbsp;
had their picture taken with her, although they insist everyone sat down
because Kournikova's statuesque 5ft 8ins makes them look squat.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Only last weekend, she publicly flirted with Britain's Henman at a specially
staged Adidas media event. She was asked: "Anna, what are the good things
about being a tennis player going around the world?" With a coy smile she
responded: "Being here in Paris and sitting next to somebody like Tim."</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the Kournikova view of her public profile is often conflicting. One
moment she declares: "I am just a normal person, trying to benormal. There
are good things about all the attention I get and there are bad things,
but I cannot change it. I'm just trying to concentrate on playing tennis
and nothing else."</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On another day she announces: "I'm asked why do I have to look good on
court? Why not just play? But I say it's human nature for people to notice.
To me, whenever I am on court, it is like a theatre and I have to express
myself. Why should I have to look ugly just because I am an athlete?"</FONT></FONT>
