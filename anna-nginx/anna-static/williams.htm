VENUS WILLIAMS</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>
<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">It's raining in
West Palm Beach, Fla. -- one of those torrential rains where the drops
are as big as your fist, raincoats and umbrellas are useless, and even
on the fastest setting, windshield wipers can't keep up with the deluge.
Everything's flooded, there's not a dry court in sight, and Venus Williams,
teen tennis whiz, is stressed.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">But it's not because
she can't play tennis -- practice with her sister Serena on the court outside
the sprawling home she shares with her parents, prepare for the future
tournaments that will define how much of Venus Williams is hype, how much
she can actually deliver. Nope, she's anxious because her father, Richard,
is beating her at Galaga, the video game that sits in a corner of the family
room.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"Right now, my
goal is to become better than my dad," Williams says with a laugh. "I'm
about 4,000 points behind."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">At 17, Williams
is simultaneously calm and excited, poised and awkward, mature and girlish.
She talks easily about being one of the world's best tennis players, then
dissolves into giggles when her father teases her about her passion for
shopping. She has been called arrogant for naming herself when asked who
her favorite player is, a criticism she dismisses: "You have to wonder
why they're asking me that. It's probably because they don't think I can
think -- maybe because of my color, and that's sad. When I was younger,
I had favorite players, but now I've sort of grown out of that."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">What does she
see in her future? "I don't think it's possible I won't be No. 1," she
says with no hint of arrogance -- just a flat statement of the facts as
she has been raised to see them. "I'm sure I'll get where I want to go.
My parents taught us to believe in ourselves, to have confidence. I can't
remember a time I didn't feel good about myself."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Family is everything:
"My parents were taught that family should be together, and that's how
they taught us," Venus says. "I definitely don't plan to move away from
my family. I'll probably live in the next lot."</FONT></FONT></B>
<LI>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">From glass-strewn
courts to grand slam success</FONT></FONT></B></LI>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">At 6-foot-2, with
her signature beaded braids, wide grin, and a serve that's been timed at
110 mph, Venus Williams combines the size, speed and talent to shape a
game that has made her a top player.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">She started playing
at age 4 when, according to her father, he decided to groom Venus and younger
sister Serena to be tennis champions after he saw an athlete on TV win
a match and get a $30,000 check. Venus' early years in poor Compton, Calif.,
outside Los Angeles, are the stuff of legend, stories told and retold by
her father/coach: of courts paved with broken glass, serves practiced between
drive-by shootings, dedicated Dad shepherding his girls through gangs of
tough guys onto the courts.</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="amvenuspic1.jpg" HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=200></CENTER>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">At 12, Venus had
a 63-0 record on the junior circuit. She turned pro in 1994, at 14, making
her debut at the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Calif. (The next
year, she nailed a $12 million Reebok endorsement deal.) Last fall, Williams
became the first black woman since Althea Gibson in 1958 to reach the finals
of the U.S. Open. Her '97 prize money totaled nearly $470,000. This year,
teamed with Justin Gimelstob at the Australian Open, she won her first
Grand Slam title, in mixed doubles.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Currently No.
12 in the world, Williams, who won her first professional singles title
in last month's IGA Tennis Classic, still has a ways to go to catch Martina
Hingis, 17 (who has 16 singles titles), or tennis legend Chris Evert (who
won 39 singles titles in her teens). Her next chances: the French Open
in May, Wimbledon in June and the U.S. Open in August.</FONT></FONT></B>
<LI>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Dad has done "What
he thought in his heart was best"</FONT></FONT></B></LI>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Richard Williams
is not a former player or a professional coach, yet for the most part he
has directed his daughters' careers. Eschewing the usual route to the pros,
he didn't let his girls play much as juniors. He encouraged them to play
to win and for fun, to be champions but not to take any of it too seriously.
He always has valued school above sports, to the point of taking away Venus'
racket when he felt she was neglecting more important aspects of life.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Richard's approach
has attracted attention, as much for his comments on tennis and those who
play it as for his non-traditional coaching methods. During last year's
U.S. Open, which he declined to attend but watched on TV (he considers
going to matches a waste of his time), Richard called 11th-seeded Irina
Spirlea "a big, ugly, tall white turkey" after she collided with Venus
during a changeover. He refers to tennis as "silly," and even though he
calls the shots, it is usually not he but Oracene, his wife and the mother
of their five daughters, who travels with Venus. (The three older Williams
children are Yetunde, Isha and Lyndrea.)</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Long before anyone
knew of Venus' tremendous talent, her dad was blowing her horn to anyone
who would listen, and a lot who wouldn't. With his thick Louisiana accent,
casual demeanor and colloquial English, Richard Williams calls himself
"a little ignorant man out of southeast Compton." He denies he has masterfully
manipulated every aspect of Venus' career, and dismisses coups like her
Reebok contract (negotiated when she was more hype than proven talent)
as "maybe luck, but we just considered it common sense." Still, it's clear
Richard Williams is shrewd, a man from outside the traditionally white,
upper-class tennis world who has learned to play the game within the game.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"Richard always
wants to be in control, and that's not bad," says Rick Macci, who coached
Venus from 1991 to 1995 and has coached Jennifer Capriati and other top
young players. "He has done what he thought in his heart was best for his
girls. He gets an A-triple plus for being the type of parent he is. He's
got educated, well-mannered kids who have their priorities in line."</FONT></FONT></B>
<LI>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"I see her going
straight to the top"</FONT></FONT></B></LI>


<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Priorities seem
very much in evidence this rainy afternoon at the 10-acre Williams estate
in Florida. Venus hunches intently over Galaga until summoned to an interview.
Serena sprawls in a chair, reading. Richard and Oracene chat quietly. The
scene is cozy, almost idyllic. No music blares, voices are modulated, the
familiar teenage air of discontent is entirely absent. If you didn't know
otherwise, you'd have a hard time believing the lanky young woman horsing
around with her family goes for the jugular on the court.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"I've prepared
to be in competition all my life," says Venus. "I just try to improve,
so the next time around I don't make the same mistakes."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Asked about criticism
that she is aloof from other players on tour, she shrugs. "I'm looking
to win matches, to be the best. I'm not looking for friends. You really
can't find a friend these days. You have your family, you have your God,
and that's about it."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Does she carry
the burden of being a racial representative? "If I'd lived prior to the
1980s, it would have been different, because I would have been playing
to prove African Americans are equal. Now, I don't necessarily feel I have
to play for black people, because obviously they're doing everything in
all sports. If I can go out there and play for myself and not feel I have
to stand for something other than what I want to do, that's good."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Zina Garrison,
who played on the women's tour for 15 years, knows the pressures Williams
faces. "She's in a great position, and she's been raised to be in that
position as an African American in a mostly white sport," says Garrison,
who works with inner-city junior tennis players in Houston. "It helps her
that she has the strength, confidence and arrogance you need to become
the top player in the world. I see her going straight to the top."</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Time is of the
essence. Williams, who graduated from high school last year and is taking
college courses as her tennis schedule permits, doesn't intend to play
past age 26. That's when she'll focus on becoming an architect and clothing
designer.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">"A lot of people
have more problems than going out and being the best," Williams says, laughing.
"A lot of people are unhappy working 9 to 5, struggling, doing all kinds
of things to keep afloat. I don't look at the practice and discipline as
pressure; I look at it as working to be the best. I shouldn't want it to
come easy, because that way it isn't a challenge."</FONT></FONT></B>
