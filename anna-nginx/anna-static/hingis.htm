first started to play Tennis at the ripe old age of three and started to
play in tournaments at the mature age of five!!. Things then started to
move on quickly, just six years from picking up a racket she became the
Czechoslovakian Champion at nine. It was at this time she and her mother
moved to a new residence and Country adopting Switzerland as their new
home.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Nearing the age
of twelve she become the Swiss outdoor champion, just over a year later
she added the indoor title as well!!. In 1991 she entered into the Junior
Championship at the French Open and landed her first serious title, later
that same year she played in the Junior Tournament at Wimbledon where she
reached the Semi-finals.</FONT></FONT></B>

as French Junior champion, she did not enter the Swiss indoor championship
in 1994 but landed her first Wimbledon Junior title and was the finalist
in the US open Junior Championship held at Flushing Meadow.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">She was now the
European Ladies No.1, and shortly afterwards she turned professional on
October 14 that year.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">In 1995 her first
full season in the professional ranks she finished runner-up at her first
WTA-tournament in Hamburg, and landed the doubles title at the same tournament.</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#3366FF">Her first singles
title soon followed as she was successful in winning the Le Cap D'agde
tournament, beating household names such as Huber, Novotna, Malejeva, Sanchez
and Pierce. This success lead to her new highest ranking reaching the number
16 spot on the WTA-list.</FONT></FONT></B>

a year which started very well in the blistering heat of Australia where
she cruised through to her first ever grand slam final beating Mary Pierce,
and for good measure landed the doubles as well. Her passion for horses
was probably her undoing at the French Open when five weeks before the
championships began, she fell off her trusty steed and injured her thigh.</FONT></FONT></B>
